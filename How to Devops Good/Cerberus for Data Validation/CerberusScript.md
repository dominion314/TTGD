Hello IT breatheren, I am back with another video, thank you for joining me. Today I'm going to teach you how to devops and in this video we're going to touch on a few things. We're going to review CI/CD, write some python code, mess with regex, learn a bit a bout YAML, and discuss a high level overview of Private Services Access.

Simply stated, we're going to create a python script that reads a customer request for a new PSA and ensures that it meets all of our code requirements. 

This video is not meant to be a stand alone lesson, but rather to provide you some insight into the work of a devops engineer. I'm going to explain things to the best of my ability, but I will be moving fast so if you're unsure about something, post your questions in the comments below.

So be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel, and without further ado lets get started. 

-The first thing we want to do with any project we're writing is to state our objective.
    - As mentioned before our goal is to write a script that will review a customer merge request and ensure it meets our code requirements. We will write a python script utilizing the Cerberus library and additionally will define a YAML policy to enforce our parameters.

-Lets also write the string we will be submitting to a higher truth.

-We want to define our function that will return true or false based on our strings.

As you can see truth is a very definitive piece of logic, not to be confused with relative thinking. True or False statements are great for programs that determine whether you have enough money in your account or if your card should be declined.  

So I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough and the code for this video will be posted in the description below. Be sure to like and subscribe and as always, Ill see you in the next one!
